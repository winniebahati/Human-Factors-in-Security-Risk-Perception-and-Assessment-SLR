# The role of Data Flow Diagrams in validating identified security threats- Replication package
This repository contains the studies used in the systemitasation of knowledge on the humna fcators that effect security risk perception and assessment. Data extraction, from digtal libraries (ACM digital library, IEEE Xplore,
Scopus, and Google Scholar), was carried out on the 20th of October, 2022

### General overview
To gather evidence, we formulated a search string consisting of keywords used to retrieve relevant publications from digital libraries. The search string underwent numerous review processes with experts. The search string was subject to a two step quality assessment steps. They include; First, the search string underwent iterative development and refinement through the collaborative efforts of the first and third authors. In addition, we sought advice from an external professor (with over 10 years of experience in security-by-
design and a track record of SoK publications) who assessed the relevance of the search string with respect to the research questions and concluded that the search string is appropriate.

The keywords used to extract the studies are outlined below;

1. (gender OR age OR education OR nationality OR human factors OR divers*) AND
2. (security OR safety) AND
3. (risk OR threat) AND
4. (assessment OR analysis OR modeling) AND
5. (system OR software OR application)



### Available material for replication
To aide in future replication of this study, we have made available the following materials;
1. Extracted data from each digital library (.bib)
2. Data after removal of duplicates
3. Resulting publications after the first filtering step (I/E on title and keywords)
4. Sample participants report and exit questionnaire
5. python notebook
